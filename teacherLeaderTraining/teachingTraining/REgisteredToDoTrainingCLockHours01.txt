In this 3-hour course, administrators will learn how to 
strategically navigate the financial management of their 
early childhood program. Administrators will learn about
 organizational lifecycle stages and how this framework 
can be applied to manage a sustainable early childhood 
program. Administrators will explore elements of financial 
management and discuss how these can be applied within 
their program to promote transparency and financial 
sustainability. Administrators will discuss circumstances
 that pose a financial risk and strategies for identifying 
and mitigating risks within their program.

Description
Children are wired for learningâ€“they are good at it, eager to do 
it, and driven to it. Yet, too often, they are not supported in
 leading their own learning. Based on ideas from our book, Let 
Them Play, this session is about trusting kids as learners and 
creating environments where they are empowered and supported in
 leading their learning.
