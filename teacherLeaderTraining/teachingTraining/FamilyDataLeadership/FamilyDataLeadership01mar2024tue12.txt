I have to find out my reason for "why"
We tend to focus on what



Proprietary process

What is your purpose, cause

Why should anyone caare

Inspired organizations think act from inside out

Eg:apple
  Why
  How
  What

Gateway came up with flat screen tv
Dell MP3 and PDAs
Noone bought them, but people bought from apple
Because Appple drives people's BEHAVIOR
  People feel it is right to buy from apple

Part of brain that controls decision making
does not control language
