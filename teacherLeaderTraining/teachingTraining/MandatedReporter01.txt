3 STEPS TO COMPLETE TRAINING
Complete Pre-Test
Prior to beginning the training, it is important to take the Mandated Reporter Training Pre-Test.

Learners will be allowed one opportunity to take this pre-test and there is no requirement to obtain a certain score.

Complete Lessons/Explore FAQs

Complete Post-Test, earn 80% for Certificate
To complete the training and earn 2 clock hours, learners must successfully complete the training post-test. The post-test is an opportunity to demonstrate knowledge acquired from this training.

While learners must earn a score of 80% or better for successful completion, the test can be retaken to achieve this goal. As the questions are derived directly from the course materials, it is strongly recommended that learners take the time to fully engage the training materials in an in-depth manner.

Certificate of Completion

Learners who score 80% or greater on the post-test have successfully completed the training and earned 2 clock hours.

To print your certificate, right-click on the page and select Print from the popup menu.
